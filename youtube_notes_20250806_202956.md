Okay, I understand the situation. Since the `NotesCreatorAgent` is unable to create the notes due to the API issue, there are no notes for me to enhance at this time. My role is to enhance *existing* notes.

Once the transcript issue is resolved and notes are generated, please provide them to me, and I will proceed with the enhancements as described earlier.
